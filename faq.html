<p>Q: What software do you use?
<br>
<p>A: Music: Mixcraft 7 Home Studio
<br>
Song/album artwork: paint.net and sometimes Audacity (don't ask)
<br>
Web editing: <s>Notepad</s> Sublime Text 3, Github Desktop for Windows
</p>
<br>

<p>Q: More specifically, how do you make the songs in Mixcraft?
<br>
A: Currently, all the music I've posted was sequenced by hand on the program's piano roll.
I recently got a MIDI controller keyboard, but haven't yet released any music made with it.

<br>

<p>Q:Can I use your music in my project?
<br>
A: Feel free to do anything non-commercial with the music available for download! I would appreciate credit, though.
If you're wondering, Youtube's content ID system won't bite you for using it in a video.
</p>
<br>

<p>Q: Do you have a tweetbook-facespace-linktube+?
<br>
A: Right now, I have a Youtube channel and a website with an RSS feed. Subscribing to either will give
you the same notifications about new things and the occasional announcement.
