<h3>Production</h3>
<p>Q: What software do you use?
<br>
<p>A: Music: <a href="http://www.acoustica.com/mixcrafths/">Mixcraft 7 Home Studio</a>
<br>
Song/album artwork: <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html">paint.net</a> and sometimes <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> (don't ask)
<br>
Web editing: <s>Notepad</s> <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a>, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop for Windows</a>
</p>
<br>

<p>Q: More specifically, how do you make the songs in Mixcraft?
<br>
A: Currently, all the music I've posted was sequenced on the program's <a href="piano-roll.html">piano roll</a> with a good old mouse and keyboard.
It can take hours of iterating over the same the minute of music before it's ready for release.
I recently got a MIDI controller keyboard, but haven't yet released any music made with it.

<h3>Copyright and stuff</h3>
<p>Q:Can I use your music in my project?
<br>
A: Feel free to do anything non-commercial with the music available for download! I would appreciate credit, though.
If you're wondering, Youtube's content ID system won't bite you for using it in a video.
</p>
<br>

<p>Q: You should try and do this for a living! How can I give you money?
<br>
A: I'm just kidding, this isn't a frequently asked question. :(
<br>
If you appreciate the music and want to give a nice gesture, a lot of it's available through paid stores like iTunes.
Bandcamp lets you name your price.

<h3>Other</h3>
<p>Q: Do you have a tweetbook-facespace-linktube+?
<br>
A: Right now, I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT27sPWtOwjhNl6XzejSIdg">Youtube channel</a> and an <a href="Sam%20Hendrickson.xml">RSS feed</a> for this website. Subscribing to either will give
